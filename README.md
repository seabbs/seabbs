### Hi there 👋

##### I'm an infectious disease researcher interested in real-time analysis, forecasting, semi-mechanistic modelling, and open source tool development. More on my research interests [here](https://samabbott.co.uk/research).

##### NOW

- Working at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine** in the [Epiforecasts](https://github.com/epiforecasts/) group; 
- ⭐ Crafting extensions to [forecast.vocs](https://github.com/epiforecasts/forecast.vocs) 📦;
- ✨ Crafted last [epinowcast](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epinowcast) 📦; 
- 🧻 Currently working on:
    - [Estimation of the test to test distribution as a proxy for generation interval distribution for the Omicron variant in England](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.08.22268920)
    - [Real-time estimation of the time-varying transmission advantage of Omicron in England using S-Gene Target Status as a Proxy](https://epiforecasts.io/omicron-sgtf-forecast/summary)
    - [Evaluating the use of real-time sequences for short-term forecasting](https://github.com/epiforecasts/evaluate-delta-for-forecasting)
    - [Evaluating a new method for nowcasting right truncated count data](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-germany-sm-nowcasting).

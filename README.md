### Hi there 👋

##### I'm an infectious disease researcher interested in real-time analysis, forecasting, semi-mechanistic modelling, and open source tool development. More on my research interests [here](https://samabbott.co.uk/research).

##### NOW

- Mostly working @[**CDC Centre for Forecast and Outbreak Analytics**](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html);
- Also @[**Epiforecasts**](https://github.com/epiforecasts/) (part of the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**); 
- ⭐ Contributing to the [epinowcast community](https://epinowcast.org) developing tools and methods for current surveillance of infectious disease and preparing for future outbreaks;
- 🧻 Currently working on:
    - [Estimating delay distributions accounting for common biases](https://github.com/parksw3/epidist-paper)
    - [Developing a workbench for real-time and outbreak infectious disease modelling](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/model)
    - 😴 🔌 🐑

##### BIO

- 🏢 I'm currently working with **CDC Centre for Forecast and Outbreak Analytics** and at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**
- 🏢 2020-2023: Postdoc in real-time modelling of infectious disease w/ [Sebastian Funk](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/funk.sebastian) at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**
- 🏢 2017-2019: Data Scientist at [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/)
- 📜 2016-2019: [PhD](https://github.com/seabbs/thesis) at the **University of Bristol** on modelling the use of the BCG vaccine in the UK
- ⚙️ I use daily: `R`, `stan`
- 🏗️ I like to perform analysis using novel models on interesting data and generalise those approaches into software 📦s 
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the [**epinowcast community**](https://epinowcast.org)
- 🌱 (Very slowly) Learning all about **Julia** and **Turing.jl**
- 📘 Reading: [Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-patterns-elements-reusable-object-oriented/dp/0201633612)
- 💬 Ping me about **statistical modelling of infectious diseases**, **real-time analysis of infectious diseases**, **estimating transmission dynamics in real-time**, and **team science opportunities**

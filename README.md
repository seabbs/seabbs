### Hi there 👋

##### I'm an infectious disease researcher interested in real-time analysis, forecasting, semi-mechanistic modelling, and open source tool development. More on my research interests [here](https://samabbott.co.uk/research).

##### NOW

- Working at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine** in the [Epiforecasts](https://github.com/epiforecasts/) group; 
- ⭐ Crafting extensions to [epinowcast](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epinowcast) 📦;
- 🧻 Currently working on:
    - [Evaluating a simplified forecast model in comparison to the ECDC forecasting hub ensemble](https://github.com/epiforecasts/simplified-forecaster-evaluation/blob/main/docs/paper/paper.Rmd)
    - [Evaluating the use of real-time sequences for short-term forecasting](https://github.com/epiforecasts/evaluate-delta-for-forecasting)
    - [Evaluating a new method for nowcasting right truncated count data](https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-germany-sm-nowcasting).


##### BIO

- 🏢 I'm currently working at **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**
- 📜 I did my [PhD](https://github.com/seabbs/thesis) at the **University of Bristol**
- ⚙️ I use daily: `R`, `stan`
- 🏗️ I like to perform analysis using novel models on interesting data and generalise those approaches into software 📦s 
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **R Community**
- 🌱 (Very slowly) Learning all about **Julia** and **Turing.jl**
- 📘 Reading: [Modeling Discrete Time-to-Event Data](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-28158-2)
- 💬 Ping me about **statistical modelling of infectious diseases**, **real-time analysis of infectious diseases**, **estimating transmission dynamics in real-time**, and **team science opportunities**

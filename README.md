### Hi there 👋

##### I'm an infectious disease researcher interested in real-time analysis, forecasting, semi-mechanistic modelling, and open-source tool development.

##### NOW

- Mostly working @[**Epiforecasts**](https://github.com/epiforecasts/) (part of the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**);
- Also supporting @[**CDC Centre for Forecast and Outbreak Analytics**](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html);
- ⭐ Contributing to the [epinowcast community](https://epinowcast.org) developing tools and methods for current surveillance of infectious disease and preparing for future outbreaks;
- 🧻 Currently working on:
    - [If we want an estimate of the reproduction number do we need the renewal process?](https://github.com/cdcgov/Rt-without-renewal) and associated Julia modelling toolkit.
    - [Developing a workbench for real-time and outbreak infectious disease modelling](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/model)
    - [Course materials on nowcasting, forecasting, and evaluation](https://github.com/nfidd/nfidd)
    - 😴 🔌 🐑

##### BIO

- 🏢 2024-: Assistant professor in real-time modelling of infectious disease w/ [Sebastian Funk](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/funk.sebastian) at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**
- 🏢 2023-: Contractor supporting the **CDC Centre for Forecast and Outbreak Analytics**
- 🏢 2020-2023: Postdoc in real-time modelling of infectious disease w/ [Sebastian Funk](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/funk.sebastian) at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine**
- 🏢 2017-2019: Data Scientist at [Funding Circle](https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/)
- 📜 2016-2019: [PhD](https://github.com/seabbs/thesis) at the **University of Bristol** on modelling the use of the BCG vaccine in the UK
- ⚙️ I use daily: `R`, `julia`, `stan`
- 🏗️ I like to perform analysis using novel models on interesting data and generalise those approaches into software 📦s 
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the [**epinowcast community**](https://epinowcast.org)
- 🌱 Learning all about **Julia** and **Turing.jl** - currently wondering why in the world you would use callables.
- 📘 Reading: [Probability and random processes](https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/probability-and-random-processes-9780198847595?cc=gb&lang=en&)
